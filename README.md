This is the main repository for Frog Girl Adventures, a puzzle game I have been developing as a side project during my most stressful times. Hopefully I will publish it soon. You can find the link to the game at the top right of the repository main page.

You can see the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to take part in the early stages of the project.
