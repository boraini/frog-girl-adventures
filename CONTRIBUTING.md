# Adding new Levels
You can add new levels by adding a new file under the levels folder and creating a pull request. A guide to creating levels can be found [here.](docs/level0.md)

# Feature Requests
If you have a new object or game mechanic idea feel free to share it. I will give you credit if it ends up in production.
